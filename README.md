## The project should:

- Have permissions
- Have account creation for non superuser members
- simple CRUD operations
- One model

## Django rest framework implementation:

- Move permissions over to DRF
- Should have refresh tokens
- on account creation check:
 - validation for password
 - validation for username - if exists throw error

## For React:

 - reresh tokens implementation
 - Should conditionally render pages on permissions
 - Should conditionally allow CRUD operations on permissions
